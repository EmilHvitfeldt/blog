      <title>Is Left-Center-right a loaded game?</title>

      <description>Lately we have been playing the dice game Left Center Right and since it is entirely a game of chance, I figured it wouldn’t hurt to run some simulations to figure out a little bit more about the nature of the game.
For those of you that doesn’t know the game here is a brief explanation:
 If a player has fewer than three chips left, he is still in the game but his number of chips is the number of dice he rolls on his turn, rather than rolling all three.</description>

      <description>After attending useR!2017 for the first time, which great pleasure and new connections made. I decided to see if I could extract some of the information available in the public schedule. So as with my last post I’ll do a bit of scraping followed by a few visualizations.
Packages library(tidyverse) library(stringr) library(utils) library(plotly) library(ltm) require(visNetwork)  Web scraping I found this task easiest with the help of purrr:map().</description>

      <title>Repetition in musicals with tidytext</title>

      <description>Lately I have been wondering how to quantify how repetitive a text is, specifically how repetitive are the lyrics to songs. I’m by no means the first one, Colin Morris did a great piece on language compression with his Are Pop Lyrics Getting More Repetitive? which i highly recommend you go read. Instead of looking at pop lyrics will we instead be focusing some popular musicals to see if general patterns emerge within each show.</description>

      <description>With Reporters Without Borders coming out with its 2017 World Press Freedom Index in the same week as Hadley Wickham comming out with the emo(ji) package, I had no choice but to explore both of them at the same time.
Disclamer! This post is not an exercise in statistical inference but rather a proof of concept of how to use the emo(ji) package with ggplot2.
