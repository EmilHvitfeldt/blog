<h1>Day 16: Sparkline</h1>
<p>Welcome back for the 16th day of the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/packagecalendar">#packagecalendar</a>,
today we will be taking a look at the <a href="https://github.com/htmlwidgets/sparkline">sparkline</a> package by <a href="https://twitter.com/timelyportfolio">Kent Russell</a>.
The <strong>sparkline</strong> package provides a wrapper around the jQuery library <a href="https://omnipotent.net/jquery.sparkline/#s-about">of the same name</a>.</p>
<p>The package is available from CRAN and can be downloaded with</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;Sparkline&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>This package is quite similar to the <a href="https://github.com/emitanaka/datalegreyar">datalegreyar</a> package from <a href="https://www.hvitfeldt.me/pkgcal2019/1/">day 1</a>.</p>
<p><strong>sparkline</strong> will take a series of numbers and create a miniature chart from them.
Here we will reuse data from <a href="https://www.hvitfeldt.me/pkgcal2019/1/">day 13</a></p>
<p>First, letâ€™s pull out a single time-series using <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/">dplyr</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)
holy_nights_hits &lt;- carrol_trends %&gt;%
  filter(keyword == &quot;O Holy Night&quot;) %&gt;%
  mutate(hits = as.numeric(if_else(hits == &quot;&lt;1&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, hits))) %&gt;%
  pull(hits)</code></pre>
<p>Then we simply pass the vector to the <code>sparkline()</code> function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(sparkline)
sparkline(holy_nights_hits)</code></pre>
<span id="htmlwidget-1" class="sparkline html-widget"></span>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-1">{"x":{"values":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,4,5,6,9,15,21,26,38,6,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,4,6,9,14,20,24,35,15,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,3,5,6,8,13,19,22,30,24,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,4,6,7,12,18,21,26,26,3,2,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,3,4,5,7,8,15,18,24,30,4,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],"options":{"height":60,"width":"100%"},"width":"100%","height":60},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
<p>What makes <strong>sparkline</strong>s really special is the ability for you to embed them in other applications.
In the following example, we group the data by keyword and year.
Then we have a sparkline for each year inside our table.</p>
