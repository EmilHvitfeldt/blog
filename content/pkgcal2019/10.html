<p>Welcome back for the 10th day of the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/packagecalendar">#packagecalendar</a>,
today we will be taking a look at a new contender for table creation.
Iâ€™m talking about the <a href="https://github.com/glin/reactable">reactable</a> package created by <a href="https://github.com/glin">Greg Lin</a>.
<strong>reactable</strong> is a wrapper around the JavaScript library <a href="https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-table">react-table</a>.</p>
<p>The package is available from CRAN and can be downloaded with</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;reactable&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>We will be using the <code>elf</code> data from <a href="https://www.hvitfeldt.me/pkgcal2019/7/">day 7</a>.</p>
<p>You simply pass your data.frame to the <code>reactable()</code> function and it generates a nice looking table.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(reactable) 

reactable(elf)</code></pre>

<p><strong>reactable</strong> is highly customizable with its many arguments in <code>reactable()</code>.
Additionally, if you know JavaScript you can raise it to new heights.</p>
<p>There are many more things you can do with this package and I highly encourage you to visit the package <a href="https://glin.github.io/reactable/">website</a>.</p>
