<h2>What are we doing?</h2>
<p>The inspiration for this post is <a href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike/miserables/">this beutiful vizualization</a> from <a href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike/">Mike Bostock</a>. It nicely vizualizes the co-occurence of characters (when two characters appear in the same chapter) in the novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Mis%C3%A9rables">Les Mis√©rables</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Hugo">Victor Hugo</a> using the data collected by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Bertin">Jacques Bertin</a> (and his assistants).</p>
<p>The way this post will differentiate itself from this is that we are going to collect the data ourselves using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition">named entity recognition</a>. Named entity recognition is the dicipline of location and classifying named entities in text. Furthermore will we also try to cluster the characters according to their appearence in the novel.</p>

<h2>Loading package</h2>
<p>for this we will need <code>tidyverse</code> for general data science tasks, <code>cleanNLP</code> for the named entity recognition and <code>igraph</code> for some graph related transformation.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(cleanNLP)
library(igraph)</code></pre>
